        Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be seen and touched.
        <br>
        Examples of Hardware are the following 
        <ul>
            <li>Input devices − keyboard, mouse, etc.</li>
            <li>Output devices − printer, monitor, etc.</li>
            <li>Secondary storage devices − Hard disk, CD, DVD, etc.</li>
            <li>Internal components − CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        Computer Hardware Parts
        <br>
        Some of the commonly used hardware in your computer are described below:
        <ol>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Monitor</li>
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        1) Motherboard:
        <br>
        The motherboard is generally a thin circuit board that holds together almost all parts of a computer except input and output devices. All crucial hardware like CPU, memory, hard drive, and ports for input and output devices are located on the motherboard. It is the biggest circuit board in a computer chassis.
        <br>
        It allocates power to all hardware located on it and enables them to communicate with each other. It is meant to hold the computer's microprocessor chip and let other components connect to it. Each component that runs the computer or improves its performance is a part of the motherboard or connected to it through a slot or port.
        <br>
        There can be different types of motherboards based on the type and size of the computers. So, a specific motherboard can work only with specific types of processors and memory.
